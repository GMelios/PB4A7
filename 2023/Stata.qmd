## ðŸ“¢ Description
Dear All, 

For anyone that wants extra Intro (from scratch) material for STATA, I can propose the following. These should help you become STATA "experts" in little time. I know this sounds like these ads for "Build a six-pack in 10 steps" but STATA is actually much easier than that. Our seminars and a few of those videos should help you pick it up in no time. 

[LSE - DATA SKILLS LAB COURSE](https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=7882)

You can enrol here and follow at your own pace. It's supposed to take 10-14 hours to complete in total and should give anyone and superbly good background in stata. You can follow it at your own pace.
