    "section": "",
    "text": "Check-in\n\nWe’re thinking through ways that we can identify the effect of interest without having to control for everything\nOne way is by focusing on within variation - if all the endogeneity can be controlled for or only varies between-individuals, we can just focus on within variation to identify it\nPro: control for a bunch of stuff\nCon: washes out a lot of variation! Result can be noisier if there’s not much within-variation to work with\nAlso, this requires no endogenous variation over time\nThat might be a tricky assumption! Often there are plenty of back doors that shift over time\n\n\n\n\nRegression Discontinuity\n\nToday we are going to talk about Regression discontinuity design (RDD)\nRDD is currently the darling of the econometric world for estimating causal effects without running an experiment\nIt doesn’t apply everywhere, but when it does, it’s very easy to buy the identification assumptions\nNot that it doesn’t have its own issues, of course, but it’s pretty good!\n\n\n\n\nRegression Discontinuity\nThe basic idea is this:\n\nWe look for a treatment that is assigned on the basis of being above/below a cutoff value of a continuous variable\nFor example, if you get above a certain test score they let you into a “gifted and talented” program\nOr if you are just on one side of a time zone line, your day starts one hour earlier/later\nOr if a candidate gets 50.1% of the vote they’re in, 40.9% and they’re out\nOr if you’re 65 years old you get Medicaid, if you’re 64.99 years old you don’t\n\nWe call these continuous variables “Running variables” because we run along them until we hit the cutoff\n\n\n\nRegression Discontinuity\n\nBut wait, hold on, if treatment is driven by running variables, won’t we have a back door going through those very same running variables?? Yes!\nAnd we can’t just control for RunningVar because that’s where all the variation in treatment comes from. Uh oh!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression Discontinuity\n\nThe key here is realizing that the running variable affects treatment only when you go across the cutoff\nSo really the diagram looks like this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression Discontinuity\n\nSo what does this mean?\nIf we can control for the running variable everywhere except the cutoff, then…\nWe will be controlling for the running variable, closing that back door\nBut leaving variation at the cutoff open, allowing for variation in treatment\nWe focus on just the variation around the treatment, narrowing the range of the running variable we use so sharply that it’s basically controlled for. Then the effect of cutoff on treatment is like an experiment!\n\n\n\n\nRegression Discontinuity\n\nBasically, the idea is that right around the cutoff, treatment is randomly assigned\nIf you have a test score of 89.9 (not high enough for gifted-and-talented), you’re basically the same as someone who has a test score of 90.0 (just barely high enough)\nSo if we just focus around the cutoff, we close any back doors because it’s basically random which side of the line you’re on\nBut we get variation in treatment!\nThis specifically gives us the effect of treatment for people who are right around the cutoff a.k.a. a “local average treatment effect” (we still won’t know the effect of being put in gifted-and-talented for someone who gets a 30)\n\n\n\n\nRegression Discontinuity\n\nA very basic idea of this, before we even get to regression, is to create a binned chart\nAnd see how the bin values jump at the cutoff\nA binned chart chops the Y-axis up into bins\nThen takes the average Y value within that bin. That’s it!\nThen, we look at how those X bins relate to the Y binned values.\nIf it looks like a pretty normal, continuous relationship… then JUMPS UP at the cutoff X-axis value, that tells us that the treatment itself must be doing something!\n\n\n\n\nRegression Discontinuity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept Checks\n\nWhy is it important that we look as norrowly as possible around the cutoff? What does this get us over comparing the entire treated and untreated groups?\nCan you think of an example of a treatment that is assigned at least partially on a cutoff?\nWhy can’t we just control for the running variable as we normally would to solve the endogeneity problem?\n\n\n\n\nFitting Lines in RDD\n\nLooking purely just at the cutoff and making no use of the space away from the cutoff throws out a lot of useful information\nWe know that the running variable is related to outcome, so we can probably improve our prediction of what the value on either side of the cutoff should be if we use data away from the cutoff to help with prediction than if we just use data near the cutoff, which is what that animation does\nWe can do this with good ol’ OLS.\nThe bin plot we did can help us pick a functional form for the slope\n\n\n\n\nFitting Lines in RDD\n\nTo be clear, producing the line(s) below is our goal. How can we do it?\nThe true model I’ve made is an RDD effect of .7, with a slope of 1 to the left of the cutoff and a slope of 1.5 to the right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression in RDD\n\nFirst, we need to transform our data\nWe need a “Treated” variable that’s TRUE when treatment is applied - above or below the cutoff\nThen, we are going to want a bunch of things to change at the cutoff. This will be easier if the running variable is centered around the cutoff. So we’ll turn our running variable \\(X\\) into \\(X - cutoff\\) and call that \\(XCentered\\)\n\n\n\n\nVarying Slope\n\nTypically, you will want to let the slope vary to either side\nIn effect, we are fitting an entirely different regression line on each side of the cutoff\nWe can do this by interacting both slope and intercept with \\(treated\\)!\nCoefficient on Treated is how the intercept jumps - that’s our RDD effect. Coefficient on the interaction is how the slope changes\n\n\\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1Treated + \\beta_2XCentered + \\beta_3Treated\\times XCentered + \\varepsilon\\]\n\n\nOLS estimation, Dep.

This answers the question “does the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) change at the cutoff? This is called a”regression kink” design. We won’t go more into it here, but it is out there!)\n\n\n\nPolynomial Terms\n\nWe don’t need to stop at linear slopes!\nJust like we brought in our knowledge of binary and interaction terms to understand the linear slope change, we can bring in polynomials too. Add a square maybe!\nDon’t get too wild with cubes, quartics, etc. - polynomials tend to be at their “weirdest” near the edges, and we don’t want super-weird predictions right at the cutoff. It could give us a mistaken result!\nA square term should be enough\n\n\n\n\nPolynomial Terms\n\nHow do we do this? Interactions again. Take any regression equation…\n\n\\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\beta_2X^2 + \\varepsilon\\]\n\nAnd just center the \\(X\\) (let’s call it \\(XC\\), add on a set of the same terms multiplied by \\(Treated\\) (don’t forget \\(Treated\\) by itself - that’s \\(Treated\\) times the interaction!)\n\n\\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1XC + \\beta_2XC^2 + \\beta_3Treated + \\beta_4Treated\\times XC + \\beta_5Treated\\times XC^2 + \\varepsilon\\]\n\nThe coefficient on \\(Treated\\) remains our “jump at the cutoff” - our RDD estimate!\n\n\n\n                              feols(Y ~ X_cent..\nDependent Var.:                                Y\n                                                \nConstant                        -0.0340 (0.0385)\nX_centered                      0.6990.

Why or why not?\nWhy might we want to use a polynomial term in our RDD model?\nWhat relationship are we assuming between the outcome variable and the running variable if we choose not to include \\(XCentered\\) in our model at all (i.e. a “zero-order polynomial”)\n\n\n\n\nAssumptions\n\nWe knew there must be some assumptions lurking around here\nSome are more obvious (we should be using the correct functional form)\nOthers are trickier. What are we assuming about the error term and endogeneity here?\nSpecifically, we are assuming that the only thing jumping at the cutoff is treatment\nSort of like parallel trends, but maybe more believable since we’ve narrowed in so far\nFor example, if having an income below 150% of the poverty line gets you access to food stamps AND to job training, then we can’t really use that cutoff to get the effect of just food stamps\nOr if the proportion of people who are self-employed jumps up just below 150% (based on reported income), that’s a back door too!\nThe only thing different about just above/just below should be treatment\n\n\n\n\nGraphically\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Difficulties\nMore assumptions, limitations, and diagnostics!\n\nWindows\nGranular running variables\nManipulated running variables\nFuzzy regression discontinuity\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\nThe basic idea of RDD is that we’re interested in the cutoff\nThe points away from the cutoff are only useful in helping us predict values at the cutoff\nDo we really want that full range? Is someone’s test score of 30 really going to help us much in predicting \\(Y\\) at a test score of 89?\nSo we might limit our analysis within just a narrow window around the cutoff, just like that initial animation we saw!\nThis makes the exogenous-at-the-jump assumption more plausible, and lets us worry less about functional form (over a narrow range, not too much difference between a linear term and a square), but on the flip side reduces our sample size considerably\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\nPay attention to the sample sizes, accuracy (true value .7) and standard errors!\n\n\nm1 &lt;- feols(Y~treated*X_centered, data = df)\nm2 &lt;- feols(Y~treated*X_centered, data = df %&gt;% filter(abs(X_centered) &lt; .25))\nm3 &lt;- feols(Y~treated*X_centered, data = df %&gt;% filter(abs(X_centered) &lt; .1))\nm4 &lt;- feols(Y~treated*X_centered, data = df %&gt;% filter(abs(X_centered) &lt; .05))\nm5 &lt;- feols(Y~treated*X_centered, data = df %&gt;% filter(abs(X_centered) &lt; .01))\netable(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5, keep = 'treatedTRUE')\n\n                                         m1                 m2\nDependent Var.:                           Y                  Y\n                                                              \ntreatedTRUE              0.7467*** (0.0376) 0.7723*** (0.0566)\ntreatedTRUE x X_centered 0.4470*** (0.1296)   0.6671.

I don’t know you’re 89 or 90, I just know you’re “80-89” or “90-100”\nA lot less believable that the only difference between these groups is random chance and we’ve closed the back doors by focusing on the cutoff\nPlenty of other things change between 80 and 100! That’s not “smooth at the cutoff”\n\n\n\n\nGranular Running Variable\n\nNot a whole lot we can do about this\nThere are some fancy RDD estimators that allow for granular running variables\nBut in general, if this is what you’re facing, you might be in trouble\nBefore doing an RDD, think “is it plausible that someone with the highest value just below the cutoff, and someone with the lowest value just above the cutoff are only at different values because of random chance?”\n\n\n\n\nLooking for Lumping\n\nOk, now let’s go back to our continuous running variables\nWhat if the running variable is manipulated?\nImagine you’re a teacher grading the gifted-and-talented exam. You see someone with an 89 and think “aww, they’re so close! I’ll just give them an extra point…”\nOr, if you live just barely on one side of a time zone line, but decide to move to the other side because you prefer waking up later\nSuddenly, that treatment is a lot less randomly assigned around the cutoff!\n\n\n\n\nLooking for Lumping\n\nIf there’s manipulation of the running variable around the cutoff, we can often see it in the presence of lumping\nI.e. if there’s a big cluster of observations to one side of the cutoff and a seeming gap missing on the other side\n\n\n\n\nLooking for Lumping\n\nHere’s an example from the real world in medical research - statistically, p-values should be uniformly distributed\nBut it’s hard to get insignificant results published in some journals. So people might “p-hack” until they find some form of analysis that’s significant, and also we have heavy selection into publication based on \\(p &lt; .05\\). Can’t use that cutoff for an RDD!\n\n\n\n\np-value graph from Perneger & Combescure, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for Lumping\n\nHow can we look for this stuff?\nWe can look graphically by just checking for a jump at the cutoff in number of observations after binning\n\n\ndf_bin_count &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  # Select breaks so that one of hte breakpoints is the cutoff\n  mutate(X_bins = cut(X, breaks = 0:10/10)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(X_bins) %&gt;%\n  count()\n\n\n\n\nLooking for Lumping\n\nThe first one looks pretty good. We have one that looks not-so-good on the right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for Lumping\n\nAnother thing we can do is do a “placebo test”\nCheck if variables other than treatment or outcome vary at the cutoff\nWe can do this by re-running our RDD but just swapping out some other variable for our outcome\nIf we get a significant jump, that’s bad! That tells us that other things are changing at the cutoff which implies some sort of manipulation (or just super lousy luck)\n\n\n\n\nFuzzy Regression Discontinuity\n\nSo far, we’ve assumed that you’re either on one side of the cutoff and untreated, or the other and treated\nWhat if it isn’t so simple? What if the cutoff just increases your chances of treatment?\nFor example, maybe about 10% of kids with too-low test scores get into gifted-and-talented, and 80% of kids with high-enough scores do\nFor whatever reason!\nThis is a “fuzzy regression discontinuity”\nNow, our RDD will understate the true effect, since it’s being calculated on the assumption that we added treatment to 100% of people at the cutoff, when really it’s 70%. So we’ll get roughly only about 70% of the effect\n\n\n\n\nFuzzy Regression Discontinuity\n\nWe can account for this with a model designed to take this into account\nSpecifically, we can use something called two-stage least squares (instrumental variables) to handle these sorts of situations\n(you can go see the instrumental variables module if you like for more detail)\nBasically, two-stage least squares estimates how much the chances of treatment go up at the cutoff, and scales the estimate by that change\nSo it would take whatever result we got on the previous slide and divide it by .7 to get the true effect\n\n\n\n\nFuzzy Regression Discontinuity\n\nNotice that the y-axis here isn’t the outcome, it’s “percentage treated”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuzzy Regression Discontinuity\n\nWe can perform this using the instrumental-variables features of feols, giving it two treatment-response functions\nThe first is an RDD specification where we use “treatment” - i.e. whether you were actually treated\nThe second uses the same RDD specification, but replaces “treatment” with “above the cutoff”\nfeols(outcome ~ controls  | XC*treated ~ XC*assigned_to_treatment)\n\n\n\n\nFuzzy Regression Discontinuity\n\n(the true effect of treatment is .4 - okay, it’s not perfect)\n\n\npredict_treatment &lt;- feols(treatment ~ X_center*above_cut, data = df)\nwithout_fuzzy &lt;-feols(Y ~ X_center*treatment, data = df)\nfuzzy_rdd &lt;- feols(Y ~ 1 | X_center*treatment ~ X_center*above_cut, data = df)\netable(predict_treatment, without_fuzzy, fuzzy_rdd)\n\n                          predict_treatment      without_fuzzy\nDependent Var.:                   treatment                  Y\n                                                              \nConstant                   0.0605.

Whereas another core course in this programme - Experimental Design and Methods for the Behavioural Science - covers best practices in designing and conducting experimental research, Quantitative Applications for Behavioural Science introduces the main statistical background of behavioural research from psychology and economics. The course will cover best practices and state of the art statistical tools that are used by psychologists and economists. All the analyses will be demonstrated on example behavioural science research, and students will learn how to identify, interpret, and evaluate appropriate analyses for different research designs, conduct their own data analysis for each of these designs as well as report the analysis for publication in a journal, and recognise and understand contemporary issues in data science analysis in psychology and economics that need to be considered for best research practices. Emphasis will be on teaching students how the same analyses are presented in psychology and economics journals so students can understand how to integrate research from these two fields that constitute behavioural science."

Whereas another core course in this programme - Experimental Design and Methods for the Behavioural Science - covers best practices in designing and conducting experimental research, Quantitative Applications for Behavioural Science introduces the main statistical background of behavioural research from psychology and economics. The course will cover best practices and state of the art statistical tools that are used by psychologists and economists. All the analyses will be demonstrated on example behavioural science research, and students will learn how to identify, interpret, and evaluate appropriate analyses for different research designs, conduct their own data analysis for each of these designs as well as report the analysis for publication in a journal, and recognise and understand contemporary issues in data science analysis in psychology and economics that need to be considered for best research practices. Emphasis will be on teaching students how the same analyses are presented in psychology and economics journals so students can understand how to integrate research from these two fields that constitute behavioural science."
