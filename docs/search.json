    "text": "📑 Course Brief\nDescription: In this course, students will immerse themselves in the world of causal inference methodologies, a cornerstone in behavioural science research. The curriculum guides learners through the essential processes of cleaning, analysing, and visualising secondary data, equipping them with the skills to conduct robust and insightful research. Through practical examples, students will learn to adeptly navigate various research designs, and develop the proficiency to communicate their findings effectively, fostering a deeper understanding and application of best practices in behavioural science.\nFocus: Understand the fundamentals of causal inference and its applications in Behavioural Science. Master statistical tools used by psychologists, political scientists, and economists. Recognize and address contemporary issues in behavioural science.\nDownload the full syllabus here\n🛠️ Requirements: For students who have no prior experience with statistics and/or STATA, the completion of the following Digital Skills class is highly recommended:\nIntroduction to STATA\n\n\n🎯 Learning Objectives\n\nHow to distinguish Causation from Correlation\nHow different research designs work\nHow to apply different research designs on Stata\nHow to effectively visualise your findings\n\n\n  Enter the class"

Whereas another core course in this programme - Experimental Design and Methods for the Behavioural Science - covers best practices in designing and conducting experimental research, Quantitative Applications for Behavioural Science introduces the main statistical background of behavioural research from psychology and economics. The course will cover best practices and state of the art statistical tools that are used by psychologists and economists. All the analyses will be demonstrated on example behavioural science research, and students will learn how to identify, interpret, and evaluate appropriate analyses for different research designs, conduct their own data analysis for each of these designs as well as report the analysis for publication in a journal, and recognise and understand contemporary issues in data science analysis in psychology and economics that need to be considered for best research practices. Emphasis will be on teaching students how the same analyses are presented in psychology and economics journals so students can understand how to integrate research from these two fields that constitute behavioural science."

    "text": "Quantitative data collection is an integral component of behavioural science: Testing hypotheses requires designing experiments and analysing the data or performing statistical analyses on secondary data. Whereas another core course in this programme - Experimental Design and Methods for the Behavioural Science - covers best practices in designing and conducting experimental research, Quantitative Applications for Behavioural Science introduces the main statistical background of behavioural research from psychology and economics. The course will cover best practices and state of the art statistical tools that are used by psychologists and economists. All the analyses will be demonstrated on example behavioural science research, and students will learn how to identify, interpret, and evaluate appropriate analyses for different research designs, conduct their own data analysis for each of these designs as well as report the analysis for publication in a journal, and recognise and understand contemporary issues in data science analysis in psychology and economics that need to be considered for best research practices. Emphasis will be on teaching students how the same analyses are presented in psychology and economics journals so students can understand how to integrate research from these two fields that constitute behavioural science."

These should help you become STATA “experts” in little time. I know this sounds like these ads for “Build a six-pack in 10 steps” but STATA is actually much easier than that. Our seminars and a few of those videos should help you pick it up in no time.\nLSE - DATA SKILLS LAB COURSE\nYou can enrol here and follow at your own pace. It’s supposed to take 10-14 hours to complete in total and should give anyone and superbly good background in stata. You can follow it at your own pace.\nYouTube Channels\nStata Intro - STATA Company itself has a 2hour introduction to STATA that is superb\nEconometrics Academy - Econometrics Academy has a playlist on Introduction to STATA\nData for Development - Data for Development has a nice set of videos as well\nSee you all soon, George"

This channel on the server is for those of you that already have some stata knowledge and want to spend the time you might have the first week(s) to expand more on programming and stats. It’s a mix of LSE courses you can attend and online material that are fantastic to help you progress.\nLSE Modules Courses on dept of methodology - here you can find courses on causal inference, advanced statistics and data science summary of courses here\nCourses from Digital Skills Lab intro to a lot of programming languages (R, STATA, Python)\nCourses from Data Science Institute Courses from B.Sc. in Data Science on Politics\nOnline Resources\n\nHertie Summer School Probably the best and most variable resource for everyone that wants to expand their knowledge on Data Science and statistics is the Hertie Summer School that is free online. Here is a course catalog and they offer courses from intro to Data science to Advanced Machine Learning, NLPs, Scraping data from the web and anything you can imagine. (the one from 2021 has more courses than the 2022 version)\nIsmail Khalil has a fantastic channel with Advanced R programming and Machine Learning on YouTube\n\nWill keep updating this on the relevant Discord Channel and here as much as possible throughout the semester.\nBest wishes, George"
