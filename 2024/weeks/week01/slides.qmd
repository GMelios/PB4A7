# What is PB4A7

## What is this class

- It‚Äôs a research design course on quasi-experimental methods
- Let‚Äôs break it down: 
  - Research Design -> How you transform an idea / question about the world to applied research
  - Quasi-Experiments -> Not by designing new experiments with random assignment. (how? We will see over the next 11 weeks)

---

## What you should expect

- **Confidence**: You will feel like you have a good understanding of design-based causal inference by the end such that it doesn‚Äôt feel mysterious or intimidating

- **Comprehension**: You will have learned a lot both conceptually but also in various specifics, particularly with regards to issues around identification and estimation

- **Competency**: You will have had some experience working together implementing these methods using code in Stata syntax

---

## What is a good research question?

- Coming up with questions is easy. 

- But coming up with good ones, is tricky. Good RQ: 
+ - **A question that can be answered / Researchable**: 
  - How can you answer a question which is unanswerable? 
  - What versus why? Are you trying to determine what causes Y, or why something causes Y. 


- **Improve our understanding of the world**: 
  - Doesn‚Äôt have to shake the foundations of science and human knowledge
  - What if I find an unexpected result?
  
---  

## Research Designs 

- Quantitative empirical analysis uses data to explore, test or estimate a relationship.

## Causal Inference 

- Contemplating interventios that change behaviour:

  - How would littering parks change if we increase the severity of fines? 
    - Is public shaming more effective?
  - What if we increase other types of fines (i.e. driving)?
    - Will people commit less crimes?

Each of these policies is asking what happens to some outcome if we make an intervention - keep everything the same but change one factor ‚Äì

# A little throwback to causal inference

## A little throwback

- October 2021‚Äôs Nobel Prize in economics went to D. Card, J. Angrist and G. Imbens

- But it‚Äôs arguably as much to Princeton‚Äôs mid 1980s Industrial Relations group as it‚Äôs ground zero for the credibility revolution

- Starts with Orley Ashenfelter, who had been working on job trainings programs

- KEY individuals: Orley Ashenfelter, David Card (Orley‚Äôs student), Josh Angrist (Card and Orley‚Äôs student), Alan Krueger (hired by Orley), Bob Lalonde (Card and Orley‚Äôs student) and then a generation of students (Levine, Currie, Pischke)

---

## A little throwback

- Angrist started working on how randomization in Vietnam drafting can explain later outcomes (we will see this in Week 10)

- Meets Gibens and they both get mentored by Gary Chamberlain

- They propose the potential outcomes framework

- This course is about these people, their ideas, subsequent development and how the revolutionised modern empirical research with observational data

# Research Designs and Causality 

## Research Designs and Causality 

Example: If we want to know whether a vaccine works

- We compare people who have gotten vaccinated and those who took a placebo instead


<figure>
    <img src="/2024/weeks/week01/vaccines.png" alt="RD"
    class="img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom">

## Research Designs and Causality 

Example: If we want to know whether a vaccine works

- We compare people who have gotten vaccinated and those who took a placebo instead

- In a classic clinical experiment, one applies a ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô (0 = placebo, 1 = vaccine) to some set of n ‚Äòsubjects‚Äô and observes some ‚Äòoutcome‚Äô (Y).

- We can then estimate:
+ - Y = infection(0,1)

---

## Research Designs and Causality 

- Each individual _i_ is assigned into one of the treatment options (0 = placebo, 1 = vaccine)

- Therefore, each i as two potential outcomes:

  - What would happen if they got the placebo? _Y<sub>i_ (0)
  - What would happen if they got the vaccine? _Y<sub>i_ (1)

- Did vaccines prevent infection? 
  - To answer this we need to know what happened to the individual if they got the vaccine and what happened to the same individual if they got the placebo.

--- 

## Counterfactuals

- What actually happened (i.e., the ‚Äòfactual‚Äô):
    - I got the vaccine and did not get sick
    - Treatment (X) = 1
    - Observed outcome = _Y<sub>i_(1)

- The counterfactual: (what would have happened)
    - If I did not get the vaccine, would I have fallen sick?
    - Counterfactual treatment (X) = 0
    - Counterfactual outcome = _Y<sub>i_(0)

--- 

## Counterfactuals

- After treatment is assigned there is potential for only one outcome to be observed

## Counterfactuals

- But ideally we would like to observe two:

## Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

- Once we observe one treatment for one individual, we cannot observe a different treatment for the same individual.

- This is called the ‚Äúfundamental problem of causal inference.‚Äù Each potential outcome is observable, but we can never observe all of them.‚Äù (Rubin, 2005, p. 323).

- Then, why are we discussing all these?

- Once we observe one treatment for one individual, we cannot observe a different treatment for the same individual.

- This is called the ‚Äúfundamental problem of causal inference.‚Äù Each potential outcome is observable, but we can never observe all of them.‚Äù (Rubin, 2005, p. 323).

- Then, why are we discussing all these? 

- We **can** observe different treatments across **different people**. 

- This may be a way of solving the fundamental problem, but it introduces a new problem we must consider.

--- 

## Selection Bias

- This new problem arises because different people are‚Ä¶ **DIFFERENT**!

<figure>
    <img src="/2024/weeks/week01/people.png" alt="RD"
    class="img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom">
</figure>

--- 

## Selection Bias

- Differences between people following a treatment may be because of the treatment, or they may be because of the differences in the people being treated. 

- This is selection bias.

- Let‚Äôs consider some other factors which may matter for selection bias.

<figure>
    <img src="/2024/weeks/week01/differences.png" alt="RD"
    class="img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom">
</figure>

--- 

## Addressing Selection Bias

- Select a large enough random sample and divide them into two groups.

    - Characteristics which contribute to selection bias should on average be distributed the same between both groups.
    - Therefore, we expect that the treatment and control groups should differ only because of the treatment, and in absence of the treatment, would produce the same results.


--- 

## Addressing Selection Bias

- Each group differs **within** the group‚Ä¶

- But, **on average**, the groups themselves are the same, and so are **comparable**.

- The effect of treatment on average would then be:

- E(Y | T = 1) ‚Äì E(Y | T = 0) =  Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

---

## Treatment effect 

- The effect of the intervention then would be: 

  - Treatment effect of intervention = Outvome of Treated - Outcome of Untreated + Selection Bias 

  - Selection bias is the difference in average outcomes between treatment and control groups due to factors other than the treatment status

  - The true treatment effect, selection bias needs to be eliminated, or shown to be reasonably assumed to be zero.

  - To eliminate selection bias, we need well designed experiments (Matteo's class) and large enough samples 

---

## Experiments not always the solution 

- Time consuming and expensive
- May have ethical issues
- Require large samples for the assumptions to hold
- Suffer from drop-out and non-compliance
- Estimated parameters in an experiment may different from the parameters in which the intervention will actually take place.
- Not very easy to observe ‚Äòreal‚Äô behaviours or consequential behaviours because of the setting.
- An interesting paper on the [limits of RCTs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953617307359) from Deaton (Nobel laureate) and Cartwright (2017), if you‚Äôre interested!
- **What do we do then?**

---

## Causal inference

- We design a strategy (**Identification Strategy** from now on) that allows us to:

    - Identify and isolate the random variation in treatment (i.e. a natural disaster)
    - Rely on institutional knowledge, theory and data to:
      - Reduce as much as possible Selection Bias
      - Identify outcomes for treated and untreated populations
      - Estimate average treatment effects 

---

# Data Generating Process

- To avoid identification error, economists think closely about the *data generating process*
- What is a data generating process?
- The data generating process is the *true set of laws* that determine where our data comes from
- For example, if you hold a rock and drop it, it falls to the floor
- What is the data we observe? (Hold the rock & Rock is up) and (Let go & Rock is down)
- What is the data generating process? Gravity makes the rock fall down when you drop it

---

## Data Generating Process

- Another example is a model of supply and demand
- We observe prices and quantities in a competitive market
- What led to those being the prices and quantities we see?
- The supply and demand model and its equilibrium, we theorize!

---

## Data Generating Process


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(tibble(x = c(1:100,1:100), y = c(100:1, 1:100), linet = c(rep('Theoretical D',100),rep('Theoretical S',100))),
       aes(x=x, y=y, group = linet))+
  geom_line(size = 1.5, color = 'black') + 
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = linet, x = x + 2), size = 16/.pt, direction = 'y', force = 10) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 120)) +
  geom_point(data = tibble(x = 50.5, y = 50, linet = 'x'), color = 'red', size = 8) + 
  annotate(geom = 'text', x = 53, y = 50, color = 'red', label = 'Observation', hjust = 0, size = 16/.pt) + 
  labs(x = "Q", y = "P") +
  theme_minimal()
```


---

## Data Generating Process

- The prices that we observe come from that theoretical construct
- When we see the prices and quantities moving, according to our theory, it's because the S and D lines are moving
- But we can't see the S and D lines
- Our goal: use the observations we do see to *infer* what the theoretical model (data generating process) is

---

## Data Generating Process

- Harder than it sounds. What inference about S and D can we draw from these observations?

```{r}
ggplot(tibble(x = c(25,35,25,50,60), y = c(35,22,75,54,80)),
       aes(x=x, y=y))+
  geom_point(size = 6, color = 'red') + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 120)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,100)) +
  labs(x = "Q", y = "P") 
```

---

# Causality

- A data generating process can be described by a series of *equations* that describe where the data comes from. For example:

$$ X = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1\varepsilon + \nu $$

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \varepsilon $$

- This says " $X$ is caused by $\varepsilon$ and $\nu$, and $Y$ is caused by $X$ and $\varepsilon$"
- The *truth* is that an increase in $X$ *causally increases $Y$* by $\beta_1$
- The goal of econometrics is to be able to estimate what $\beta_1$ is accurately

---

## Causality

- We can also represent this set of relationships as a graph, with arrows telling you what variables cause each other

```{r, dev = 'CairoPNG', fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
library(dagitty)
library(ggdag)

dag <- dagify(X ~ epsilon + nu,
              Y ~ X + epsilon,
              coords = list(x = c(X = 1, Y = 3, nu = 1, epsilon = 2),
                            y = c(X = 1, Y = 1, nu = 2, epsilon = 2)))
ggdag_classic(dag, size = 5) + 
  theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(color = '#FAFAFA',fill='#FAFAFA'),
        plot.background = element_rect(color = '#FAFAFA',fill='#FAFAFA'))
```

---

## Causality

- We do this because most of the relationships we're interested in are causal - we want to know, if we could reach in and *manipulate* $X$, would $Y$ change as a result, and how much?
- Does the minimum wage reduce employment?
- Does quantitative easing avert recessions?
- Does six-sigma improve business performance?
- Does getting an MBA make you a better manager?

---

## Causality

- Imagine this is the graph we see for minimum wage and employment

```{r, out.width = '600px'}
knitr::include_graphics('Lecture_1_MinWage.jpg')
```

---

## Causality

- Does that mean that the minimum wage harms employment? 
- Maybe! But also maybe not
- What the graph shows us is a *correlation*
- And *correlation is not the same thing as causation*

---

## Causality

- A given correlation, like the negative relationship between minimum wage changes and employment changes, can be consistent with a *number* of different causal relationships
- As econometricians, we need to figure out which one it is!
- How can we narrow it down?
- How many of the diagrams on the next page can be consistent with that negative relationship?

---

## Eight Possible Relationships

```{r, out.height = '550px'}
knitr::include_graphics('Lecture_1_Relationships.png')
```

---

## Causality

- The only ones we can eliminate are d, g, and h
- All the rest are possible!
- If f is correct, we see the negative relationship even though minimum wage has *nothing to do* with causing employment (like the ice cream and shorts example)
- If a is correct, then even though we know minimum wage causes employment to change, the *size* or even *direction* of the relationship will be wrong (why?)

---

## Causality

- So which of them is likely to be correct?
- That depends on what we think $\varepsilon$ is
- $\varepsilon$ is everything that determines $Y$ other than $X$
- Perhaps the health of the economy, or the policies that area has chosen
- So we almost certainly have a graph with $\varepsilon \rightarrow Y$
- Do those things also affect the choice to raise the minimum wage? If so we're in graph a. That downward relationship could be due to a null relationship, or even a positive one (or perhaps a *more negative* one?)

---

# Endogeneity

- So "correlation isn't causation" isn't quite complete
- It's more "only certain correlations are causal"
- Many correlations are beset by these problems like *endogeneity*, i.e. the presence of another variable like $\varepsilon$ related to both $X$ and $Y$, giving the effect a "back door"
- So the *correlation* reflects both the *causal effect* and also *the influence of $\varepsilon$*

---

# Random Experiments

- One way around this problem is to run a random experiment
- If we can randomly assign $X$, then we know we're not in graph a, because our graph looks like this!

```{r, dev = 'CairoPNG', fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
library(dagitty)
library(ggdag)
dag <- dagify(X ~ RandomAssignment,
              Y ~ X + epsilon,
              coords = list(x = c(X = 1, Y = 3, RandomAssignment = 1, epsilon = 2),
                            y = c(X = 1, Y = 1, RandomAssignment = 2, epsilon = 2)))
ggdag_classic(dag, size = 5) + 
  theme_dag_blank() + 
  expand_limits(x = c(.5,3))+
  theme()
```

---

# Random Experiments

- For this reason, random experiments are generally considered the "gold standard" 
- Although they have their own problems, of course (your experimental sample might not represent the population well, there are plenty of statistical mistakes to make, people may act differently knowing they're in an experiment, etc. etc.)
- But regardless, we're looking here at questions for which we *can't* run an experiment, becuase it's impossible or infeasible or immoral
- So one way we can think about solving this endogeneity problem with econometrics is to use our *observational data* in such a way that it behaves *as though there were an experiment being run*
- Plenty of ways to do this we'll go over in this course!

---

# Concept Check

- What does it mean to say that $X$ has a causal effect on $Y$?
- Why might the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ in data not be the same as the causal effect?
- What is an example of observational data?
- Consider the question of "Does getting an MBA make you a better manager?" What are $X$ and $Y$ here? What would be in the error term $\varepsilon$? Are we likely to have an endogeneity problem here?

---

# Spurious Correlations

- Let's visit this site all about "spurious" correlations (i.e. correlations that almost certainly do not reveal a true effect of one variable on the other): [https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)
- Take a look at how easy it is to find variables that are *related* statistically, even though clearly neither causes the other
- Do you think this correlation is an example of inferential error (just random chance) or identification error (truly *related*, but not because one causes the other)? Why?
